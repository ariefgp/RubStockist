# StockSite

A Robinhood inspired application built with Flask, React/Redux, SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL. This project is a real-time stock exchange application that allows users to trade stocks, monitor their holdings, follow stock performance with watchlists, and stay up to date with financial news.


## Features
- Watchlists - create multiple watchlists, add and delete stocks from each one, and view your watchlists in real-time
- Portfolio/Holdings - view your current holdings, buy and sell stocks at real-time prices, and view your aggregated portfolio
- Bookmarks - save news articles to read later, and view them in your bookmarks page
- Bank Info - add your fictional bank info to make deposits & withdrawals, and view your account balance
- Search - search for stocks by ticker or company name, with predictive search
- Dark Mode - toggle between dark and light mode, depending on your preference. Preferences are saved to your user account
- Real-time - see your portfolio and watchlists update in real-time as you buy and sell stocks. StockSite uses live data from the top financial APIs to retrieve stock data
